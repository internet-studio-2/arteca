Usability Testing in relation to Web Design
 
1.     Jakob Nielson created the heuristic evaluation method for usability testing, in 1994, making it accessible to a wide range of companies at low cost. Rolf Molich created a series of Comparative Usability Evaluations, resulting in a set of standards and practices for usability testing.

2.     In the United States, usability testing originated with the creation of several and independently operated labs. NCR incorporated a usability lab in 1966, followed by IBM in 1981, Belcore in 1985, and Ameritech in 1989. While Jakob Nielson did not create the idea of usability testing, his substantial contribution and research in process development popularized the methods behind successful human and computer interactions.

3.     Company usability labs incorporate the market standard for user testing; university research labs yield the best practices for today’s users; blogs can introduce new techniques by including personal experiences, and forums with input from other usability testers that include the latest tools and resources. https://www.nngroup.com/articles/traveling-usability-lab/
 
4.     The future holds an increase in accuracy in testing overall. Such as, asking the right questions, choosing the right people, integrating context and environment that is reflective of the target audience. New developments include remote usability testing with portable lab equipment, in order to make the user more comfortable in their surroundings. Also, iterative usability evaluations, which is conducting usability test with results that can be easily generalized to other users. As well as, hallway testing that tests a random sample from your targeted audience rather than trained developers.

5.     Usability testing is usually a behind the scenes process that is comprised of key elements such as learnability, memorability, efficiency, satisfaction, and errors. Our insight for usability testing is an extremely important step in the development process. The method needs to be able to adapt to the ever-changing world of technology. Have you ever been in a website that you do not know how to navigate? It is frustrating, inconvenient, and an overall hassle. For companies it can create a lost in profit, customers, and satisfaction. Usability testing is usually behind the scenes process. A little known fact about usability testing is that it is an on-going process that requires continuous testing and revisions to build and maintain efficient, easy to use products. http://blog.crazyegg.com/2013/03/26/principles-website-usability/
Insights:
-

Problems that usability testing solves for users and providers:
-prioritizing problems
-rooting out issues with interface 
-feature performance (or lack of performance)

Relevance:
-Increases user tolerance of design
-Improves navigation
-Clear call to actions
-Tailored content
-Clear/clean design that is uncluttered
-Improve design success
-Gain better idea of user needs

Where is Usability being used?
-Universities
-Research labs
-Software companies
-Web designers
-Portable labs (anywhere)
-Corporate offices

Purpose of usability testing
-Improves design
-Assess ease of use, efficiency, recovery from errors, learnability with real users
-Choosing correct audience (benefits providers)
-Cost efficiency- reduces errors, support costs, reputation, increase return on investment
-Resolves internal arguments that may lack data 
-Honest feedback from users (benefits providers)

Future of usability testing:
-Increase use of portable labs
-Optimization of consumer behavior/feedback (ex. Tobii)
-More efficient user testing 
-Rapid results
-Iterative usability evaluations
-Evidence based testing
-More cost efficient (fewer resources required)

    The RITE method—short for rapid iterative testing and evaluation, was first described by a game development team at Microsoft. They describe an idea that to many seems common sense.
    In traditional usability engineering, it is common to conduct repeated usability tests with different participants on the same design. By doing this, you can discover usability problems that are common across users. The outcome of traditional testing is often a report that communicates problems along with possible solutions.
    However, using the RITE method, we look to get errors out of the software as soon as possible. In between each test, the team discusses the problems they observed and how they might fix them. In the original Microsoft report, developers actually went to work correcting problems before they brought the next test participants in. The result isn’t a list of repeated errors and recommendations like standard usability testing, but software that has most of the errors corrected—which is what we wanted in the first place anyway.
    The smart people at salesforce.com have taken RITE and cranked the dials up to 11. They build html prototypes and iteratively test and repair them using remote usability testing. They’ll complete several rounds of this on each chunk of work before it goes into a development time-box. At Google, they describe it as “lunch room testing”—testing paper prototypes of preliminary design during lunch with Google staff at a table setup in the cafeteria.
